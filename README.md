### User Stories
Lecture Mode
* As a teacher, I want to begin a lecture room, where I can host a virtual room that my students can join and raise their hand/respond to my polls during my lecture in live time, so that I can receive feedback from all of my students in 1 sitting
* As a teacher in lecture mode, I want to see when students raise their hands in chronological order so that I can know who has questions, how many there are, and who asked their questions first
* As a teacher in lecture mode, I want to be able to post polls (such as a scale from 1-10) that my student can submit their answers to so that I know where all my students stand on average and individually in regards to a question I’ve asked
* As a student, I want to be able to join a virtual lecture room via link from my teacher or fellow classmate, so that I can send my teacher feedback and see the average of how everyone feels after the polls.
* As a student, I want to be able to raise or lower my hand so that my teacher can know when I have a question about something they’ve said or would like to say something
As a student, I want to be able to respond to the polls by clicking a number on the screen
